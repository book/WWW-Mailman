WWW-Mailman
-----------

WWW::Mailman is a module to control Mailman (as a subscriber, moderator or
administrator) without the need of a web browser.

The module handles authentication transparently and can take advantage
of stored cookies to speed it up.

It is meant as a building block for your own Mailman-managing scripts,
and will include more routines in the future.
